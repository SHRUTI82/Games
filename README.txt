CUCU Compiler
I have written both cucu.l and cucu.y file.
in lexer.txt only first two tokens are being read fronm input file and then showing syntax error.
In cucu.y file I have written Grammer rules.
My program is showing no error while compiling but it is showing syntax error while running
indicating there's a mistake in grammer rules .My lex file is correct .

./cucu a.cpp lexer.txt   (This will be syntax 1st argument input file 2nd argument lexer.txt)
